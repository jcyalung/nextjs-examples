# nextjs-examples
Authors: <b>Joshua Yalung</b>
## Purpose
This repository is to showcase unique functionalities for a website with account generation. <br>
This repository is also useful for the development of the FUSION website.

## Running the examples
<b>Unless specified otherwise in the example's folder, here is how to run these examples:</b>
<br>
Each example uses the NextJS framework, a powerful web framework built from React. Check out the documentation and how to build your own NextJS website [here.](https://nextjs.org/)
<br>
<br>
In order to start and view the websites, navigate to the example folder in your terminal. This can be done by running this command:
```
cd example-folder-name
```
While in the directory, run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will allow you to install the packages (`node_modules`) required to run the website. From here, you can launch the website by running:
```
npm run dev
```
If executed correctly, a website should be available to visit using `localhost:3000`.
